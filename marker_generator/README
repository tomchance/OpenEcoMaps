kml_generator
-------------- 

Run extract_kml.py to create the default KML files.

Options:

 -v	Run in verbose mode, will tell you each time it downloads and processes
	some XAPI data


--------------
Customising
-------------- 

You can create your own KML files with your own combination of features by
changing the extract_kml.py file.

To customise how different features are processed (i.e. what tags are used and
how they create the KML), edit 'libs/feature_defs.py'.
