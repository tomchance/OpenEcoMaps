--------------
marker_generator
-------------- 

Run extract_markers.py or similar to create the default KML and JSON files.

Options:

 -v	Run in verbose mode, will tell you each time it downloads and processes
	some XAPI data


--------------
Customising
-------------- 

You can create your own KML and/or JSON files with your own combination of 
features by changing the extract_markers.py file. This script takes a todo
list from a MySQL database.

You can also manually create KML and/or JSON files by playing with the example
script.

To customise how different features are processed (i.e. what tags are used and
how they create the KML/JSON), edit 'libs/feature_defs.py'.
