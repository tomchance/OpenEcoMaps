Introduction
--------------

OpenEcoMaps is a set of tools to provide easy-access data on sustainable living
from OpenStreetMap. It is divided into two parts:

* www - the OpenEcoMaps web site, hosted at www.openecomaps.co.uk, providing
information about the project, the public KML/GeoJSON files, an embeddable OpenLayers
set-up and a customised Potlatch 2 set-up designed to make it easy to add only
the features OpenEcoMaps provides

* marker_generator - the Python scripts that download interesting data from the
OpenStreetMap Overpass API and turns it onto pretty KML files


--------------
Deploying
--------------

The web site this is really rather simple. Pop the files in the 'www' folder
into the right place for the web server and bingo, you're done. There aren't any
complicated databases or config files to fiddle with. If you're also deploying
the kml_generator, be sure that the kml_generator is running as a user that can
write into the 'www/kml' folder.

Put the marker_generator folder anywhere you like, preferably not visible to web
browsers. Ensure the user that runs the script can write into the
'marker_generator/kml' and 'marker_generator/json' folders too.

Finally, edit the 'oem_generate_kml.sh' script to include the correct paths and
run the script to test it works. It should work through all the data then dump
fresh KML files into the 'www/kml' folder, and the equivalent for GeoJSON files.
If it is having problems, run the Python script directly with the '-v' argument
to see more detail as to what it's up to.
